In my free time, I’m a self-taught software engineer with a tendency to obsess over anything that confuses me. My life runs like a system wired for optimization, and the arrival of AI has been nothing short of transformative.</p>

<!-- My Story (Concise & High-Impact Version) -->
<div class="my-story-section">
    <h3>My Story</h3>
    <div class="story-content">
        <p>My career has been a relentless search for work with real impact. I explored paths from law enforcement to exercise science, but I was consistently frustrated by roles where I couldn't own the outcome. I needed to be closer to the solution—to build it myself.</p>
        
        <p>After a period of grinding it out in physically demanding jobs, a cross-country move to California set the stage for a new chapter. That leap of faith led me to Stryker, where I was handed a challenge that would define my path. I was hired for a new role: OnSite Specialist at the VA in Palo Alto. There was no playbook and no on-site manager.</p>
        
        <p>Day one, I was thrown into the fire of a high-stakes operating room. To survive, I started building. I taught myself Python to automate workflows, implemented AI solutions to create order from chaos, and became the single point of contact when things went wrong. I had discovered my core strength: in the absence of a system, I build one.</p>
        
        <p>When GPT-4 was released, it was the catalyst I needed to scale that instinct. I taught myself iOS development and built <strong>OpenAssistant</strong>, a 10,000-line app to solve a problem I was facing personally. I followed it with <strong>OpenCone</strong>, architecting it with Pinecone's vector search to master the technology at a deeper level. As the OpenAI API evolved, I developed <strong>OpenResponses</strong> as the next-generation successor, and most recently launched <strong>OpenIntelligence (RAGMLCore)</strong>—a privacy-first RAG system for iOS 18 that leverages Apple Intelligence and on-device processing. Every project has been a deep dive, driven by a simple need to build something useful.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not a traditional engineer. I'm a builder forged by necessity and fueled by a relentless curiosity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>I'm looking to join a hungry team that shares this ethos—a team obsessed with solving hard problems and values impact over prestige. My path has taught me how to learn, adapt, and deliver under pressure. I'm ready to bring that drive to a mission that matters.</strong></p>

                    <!-- Current status and aspirations (preserved) -->
                    <p><strong>Where I am now:</strong> Grateful for what I have and thoroughly enjoying my current role at Stryker. Recently, I've had a surge in energy that I have been pouring into my work and personal projects. As fun and fulfilling as it's been, it's gotten to the point where I've deliberately re-evaluated my goals and aspirations to match this newfound momentum.</p>
                    <p>I've come to realize that I want to be at the forefront of this technological revolution - not only because it's fascinating, but because I feel like I can contribute to its potential to transform the world in positive ways (while also considering its ethical implications).</p>
