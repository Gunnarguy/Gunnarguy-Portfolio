## Biography

I’m Gunnar - currently, I work in the Operating Room as a Medical Device Specialist where I provide intraoperative technical support.  In my free time, I’m a self-taught software engineer who, for some reason, is drawn to figure out things that confuse me.  I treat my life as a system that can be optimized, and AI has helped tremendously. I learn by doing, I adapt quickly, and I thrive in ambiguity.

Below are my core strengths, which I’ve developed since GPT-4’s inception in March 2023:

### Core Strengths

- Product Ownership:
    
    Built and maintained two App Store-published iOS apps from the ground up - UI, backend, integrations, testing, and iteration. Comfortable making technical decisions and seeing projects through.
    
- Systems Thinking:
    
    Naturally scan for inefficiencies and patterns even when I don’t necessarily want to. I connect pieces quickly, optimize the flow of whatever work is in front of me, and relentlessly iterate to close the gap between problem and solution.
    
- AI Integration:
    
    Hands-on with vector databases, LLM APIs, and embedding pipelines. Built functional RAG workflows that support real-time semantic search across user documents.
    
- Toolbelt:
    
    Xcode, VSCode, and CLI environments. Git for version control, App Store Connect for deployment, and scripts to speed up repetitive tasks.
    
- Learning Process:
    
    I learn what I need, when I need it, and improve through constant iteration. I’d rather test something live than over-plan it.

### **Philosophy**

- Success requires failure.
- If I can’t break it, I can’t understand it.
- The root of complexity is simplicity; thus, all complexities can be simplified.
